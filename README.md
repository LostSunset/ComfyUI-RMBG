|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Sensitivity**      | Adjusts the strength of mask detection. Higher values result in stricter detection. | Default value is 0.5. Adjust based on image complexity; more complex images may require higher sensitivity. |
| **Processing Resolution** | Controls the processing resolution of the input image, affecting detail and memory usage. | Choose a value between 256 and 2048, with a default of 1024. Higher resolutions provide better detail but increase memory consumption. |
| **Mask Blur**        | Controls the amount of blur applied to the mask edges, reducing jaggedness. | Default value is 0. Try setting it between 1 and 5 for smoother edge effects.                    |
| **Mask Offset**      | Allows for expanding or shrinking the mask boundary. Positive values expand the boundary, while negative values shrink it. | Default value is 0. Adjust based on the specific image, typically fine-tuning between -10 and 10. |
| **Background**      | Choose output background color | Alpha (transparent background) Black, White, Green, Blue, Red |
| **Invert Output**      | Flip mask and image output | Invert both image and mask output |
| **Performance Optimization** | Properly setting options can enhance performance when processing multiple images. | If memory allows, consider increasing `process_res` and `mask_blur` values for better results, but be mindful of memory usage. |

### Basic Usage
1. Load `RMBG (Remove Background)` node from the `üß™AILab/üßΩRMBG` category
2. Connect an image to the input
3. Select a model from the dropdown menu
4. select the parameters as needed (optional)
3. Get two outputs:
   - IMAGE: Processed image with transparent, black, white, green, blue, or red background
   - MASK: Binary mask of the foreground

### Parameters
- `sensitivity`: Controls the background removal sensitivity (0.0-1.0)
- `process_res`: Processing resolution (512-2048, step 128)
- `mask_blur`: Blur amount for the mask (0-64)
- `mask_offset`: Adjust mask edges (-20 to 20)
- `background`: Choose output background color
- `invert_output`: Flip mask and image output
- `optimize`: Toggle model optimization
